#Data analytics is the process of taking that data and using it to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights that enable organizations to make better decisions.

#There are multiple types of analytics that can generate information to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and mitigate risk.

#There are four key types of data analytics, and each answers a different type of question:

- Descriptive analytics asks, “What happened?”
- Predictive analytics asks, “What might happen in the future?”
- Prescriptive analytics asks, “What should be done next?”
- Diagnostic analytics asks, “Why did this happen?”
