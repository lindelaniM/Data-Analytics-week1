#Data analytics is the process of taking that data and using it to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights that enable organizations to make better decisions.

#There are multiple types of analytics that can generate information to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and mitigate risk.

#There are four key types of data analytics, and each answers a different type of question:

- Descriptive analytics asks, “What happened?”
- Predictive analytics asks, “What might happen in the future?”
- Prescriptive analytics asks, “What should be done next?”
- Diagnostic analytics asks, “Why did this happen?”

#The six phases of the analytic process are Asking the question, Getting the data, Investigating the data, Preparing the data, Analyzing the data, and Presenting the results. In real-world applications, the process is iterative.

# Descriptive analytics
Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large semantic models to describe outcomes to stakeholders.

By developing key performance indicators (KPIs), these strategies can help track the success or failure of key objectives. Metrics such as return on investment (ROI) are used in many industries, and specialized metrics are developed to track performance in specific industries.

An example of descriptive analytics is generating reports to provide a view of an organization's sales and financial data.

# Diagnostic analytics
Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened. Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events. Then, performance indicators are further investigated to discover why these events improved or became worse. Generally, this process occurs in three steps:

Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.

Collect data that's related to these anomalies.

Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.

# Predictive analytics
Predictive analytics help answer questions about what will happen in the future. Predictive analytics techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine if they're likely to recur. Predictive analytical tools provide valuable insight into what might happen in the future. Techniques include a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and regression.

# Prescriptive analytics
Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. By using insights from prescriptive analytics, organizations can make data-driven decisions. This technique allows businesses to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty. Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning as one of the strategies to find patterns in large semantic models. By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.

# Cognitive analytics
Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and then add these findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences, a self-learning feedback loop. Cognitive analytics help you learn what might happen if circumstances change and determine how you might handle these situations.

Inferences aren't structured queries based on a rules database; rather, they're unstructured hypotheses that are gathered from several sources and expressed with varying degrees of confidence. Effective cognitive analytics depend on machine learning algorithms, and will use several natural language processing concepts to make sense of previously untapped data sources, such as call center conversation logs and product reviews.
